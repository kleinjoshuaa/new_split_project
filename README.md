# Workspace Generator

This is a tool that lets you create new split workspaces just with a simple form. 


Enhancements could be made for error handling - right now if there are any issues with creating the environments or trafficTypes it doesn't show them back to the user. 


Install with `npm install` and ensure that a .env file exists with your API_KEY and ORG_ID strings in it. Once there, run `node index.js` and it will serve on port 3201.
